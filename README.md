## What is it?
supa-dark-notepad is a simple notepad with support for multiple files. You can also save the text stored in it for later use. It depends on cookies to save text, so make sure cookies are enabled if you want to use this. This project has been made using StackBlitz and Angular. 

## Downloading the code
If you want to download and run this project locally, you will need [Node JS](https://nodejs.org) installed. After you have installed Node JS, download and unzip the project. Open a terminal (Linux/Mac) or command prompt (Windows) and cd into the directory containing the package.json file. Then, run `npm install`. This will install all the project dependencies, so it will take a while. After it finishes, running `npm run start` should run the project. Open [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser, and it should display the notepad.

## How you can help
Feel free to give suggestions, point out bugs, or just give me plain code to add to the project! Any help would be appreciated.
